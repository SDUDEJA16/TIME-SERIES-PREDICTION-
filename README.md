# TIME-SERIES-PREDICTION- 

Google Colab is used for writing code for this project.

The objective of this project was to perdict the values of parameter -9 to parameter -13 for the 10th row of each section. This project was based on time series prediction in which we were given the data of 13 different sensors over months and by using this data we have to predict the values of the para-9 to para-13 for the 10th month of every section.

So, I have pre-processed the data as in one section there were only 9 rows instead of 10 so we have to remove it from the dataset.
Then by replacing the null values with 0.

In this Project an **Ensemble Model is used that is EXTRA TREE REGRESSOR** which makes use of multiple decision trees and combine them into one for improving the accuracy for the prediction model. It has better performance than the Random Forest Tree Algorithm.The model used in it is comprised of Bagging and random forest Algorithm.
